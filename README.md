# dotfiles-xmonad

This repo contains my xmonad configuartion, it is work in progress.
I will be adding and modifying things until I get everything set up the way I
want it and hopefully learn some haskell along the way.

## Keybindings

The `Mod` key is set to <kbd>Super</kbd> (Windows key)

## Layouts

The following layouts are configured for now:

- Master tiled horizontal (golden ratio)
- Master tiled vertical (golden ratio)
- Tabbed
- Fullscreen

## Multihead behaviour

Workspaces will be on the monitor on which they started. The configuration
should work out of the box with 1 .. n screens if they are detected correctly by
`xrandr`.

Switching to a workspace on a different screen than the current one, will change
focus to that workspace but *not* swap it with the current screen. This
behaviour is configured to be similar to `i3`'s multihead behaviour.

## Autostart applications

For convenience only `~/.xmonad/autostart.sh` is launched once on startup of
xmonad. Applications that should be autostarted can be includede here. Don't
forget the `&` after commands that will continue to run or the applications
below will never be reached.

At the moment the following application are configured for autostarting:

- Set default screenlayout (`~/.screenlayout/default.sh`)
- Set keyboard map (`setxkbmap us -variant colemak -option "caps:escape"`)
- Compositor (`picom --config ~/.config/picom/picom.conf &`)
- Wallpaper (`nitrogen --restore &`)

xmobar is started separately from the `startupHook` in xmonad's configuration.

## Dependencies

- rofi
- rofi-pass
- alacritty
- imagemagick (for screenshots)

## Appearance

The top of the configuration includes variables to define 16 colors. These will
be used throughout the configuration. The variables make adapting any
of the [base16 colorschemes](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/) easy.

The font is set to `Roboto Mono`. Make sure to have it installed or change the
`myFontName` variable accordingly.
